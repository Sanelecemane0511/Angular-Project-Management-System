# Project Management System
**Angular Framework and Frontend Development**

## Project Description
This is a Task Management application built with the Angular framework. It is designed to help users manage their work projects in a fast, modern web interface.

## Technical Skills Used
* **Framework:** Angular.
* **Languages:** TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
* **Tools:** Angular CLI, Node.js, and Git.
* **Architecture:** Component-based design.

## Main Features
* **Single Page Application (SPA):** The app is very fast because it updates the screen without reloading the whole page.
* **Task Management:** Users can add, edit, and organize project tasks.
* **Reactive Design:** The interface changes instantly when a user interacts with it.

## Technical Challenge Solved
While building this Angular app, I had a problem where the task editing boxes (modals) were not showing up correctly for certain users. I solved this by fixing the "Conditional Rendering" logic in the Angular components. This made sure the app correctly checked user data before displaying the interface, making the system more reliable.
